OPENDICOM DICOMWEB ™ and DICOM ™ Specialists

DICOMWEB ™ is an extension of DICOM ™ to allow communication of medical images and reports over HTTP. Opendicom, our company, specialized in systems architecture that facilitates this communication towards cloud services and / or distributed.

Our products are designed to facilitate the interoperability of pre-existing DICOM ™ solutions by complementation with DICOMWEB ™ extensions. They are modular and functionally complementary to each other: each higher level of functionality requires the lower levels. Our application stack consists of 5 levels above the pre-existing DICOM communication.
